# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Labs Portfolio

This repository contains my hands-on cybersecurity labs and technical notes.
Its purpose is to develop practical security skills and document my learning
process in a clear, structured, and reproducible way.

The labs focus on real-world scenarios including system enumeration,
vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and defensive security fundamentals.

---

## 🎯 Focus Areas
- Penetration Testing fundamentals
- SOC / Blue Team basics
- Active Directory & Windows security
- Network enumeration and analysis
- Vulnerability research and exploitation techniques

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
├── hackthebox/ # Hack The Box machine writeups
├── tryhackme/ # TryHackMe rooms and challenges
├── active-directory/ # AD, GPO, Windows Server labs
├── network-security/ # Networking & traffic analysis labs
└── own-labs/ # Custom VMs and self-built environments


Each lab is stored in a separate directory with its own README file describing
the objective, methodology, tools used, and conclusions.

## 🧠 Methodology
For each lab, I follow a structured approach:
1. Define the objective and scope
2. Perform enumeration and data gathering
3. Analyze findings and identify attack or defense vectors
4. Execute exploitation or mitigation steps
5. Document issues, mistakes, and solutions
6. Summarize lessons learned

Writeups emphasize **analysis and decision-making**, not just command execution.
